# Getting Ready For 401


## READ THE PROBLEM COMPLETELY, TWICE, THEN AGAIN!


- There is 7 suggested problem-solving tips listed in [This article](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/), It suggests that:
  - Reading the problem completely twice if not more can strengthen your understanding of what an input and output for an algorithm might be.
 
  - Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data (maybe one simple set of data, a complicated set, and an expected fail set if possible)


  - Optimize the manual steps laid out above
  - Write pseudo code to help get ideas across and on the board.
  - Replace psuedo code with actual code one line at a time
  - Optimize the final solution to see if it can be faster or cleaner.

## HOW TO THINK LIKE A PROGRAMMER


[Article information came from](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2)


- The best thing you can do to solve problems is to use a framework that makes sense to you.


- GOAL 1: Understand. Do everything you can to know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don't fully understand what is being asked.


- GOAL 2: Plan. Writing code right away on an interview is a terribly bad idea. Instead, talk about how you want to approach the problem, plan your solution, and plan of attack to get the desired output.


- GOAL 3: Divide and conquer. Solve small problems first, and then figure out how to tie all of the small problems together to solve the big problem. Widdle away at the solution, not try to deliver it all at once in a big blob. Don't try to solve one big proble. You will cry.


-GOAL 4: Practice! Leetcode is great for practice. Anything that stimulates problem solving (games like chess or strategy video games) can also strengthin this trait while unintentional it is still effective.


GOAL 5: Stuck! Prioritize learning. Dont look for the spolution to the big problem, find the solution to the smaller ones. This way even if the final solution is not found the interviewer gets to see your learning process, and hopefully, the interview is a growth opportunity.


## THE 5 WHYS?


[Docs](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)


- The 5 Whys uses "counter-measures" to solve problems, rather than "solutions". The 5 whys work best when within a team, Together define the problem domain and make sure everyone understands what the problem is and what needs to be solved. Then simply ask the first why question, while encouraging the team to continue asking why at least 4 more times. This will get the team a good view on the problem domain that needs to be solved.


## What is the event loop??


- The Event loop enables Async code to be run in the console. While JavaScript is a single threaded language we can use the event loop to queue up tasks to run once the call stack  is clear, meaning we can maintain beautiful UI while running complex functions in the code. When this occurs Async calls will be pushed to the event loop, The event loop pushes onto the stack when it is empty, then pops off when it is done executing. Then the next item in the event loop will proceed until the event loop and the call stack are clear.


## Super Mario!


- Make failure fun, approach failure like a video game you enjoy. When you died you didn't shut everything down and give up, you change your strategy and playstyle to overcome the challenge. The same idea applies to coding and problem solving in general. When students are rewarded for failures instead of penalized, motivation skyrockets and the success rate also correlates. Gamification of software development will make you hate yourself less!
