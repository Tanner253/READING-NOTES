# 301 Lecture 1 introduction to React

- Function expressions do not hoist
  the compiler does not see the function on the otherside of the variable declaration whereas a vanilla declaration will hoist correctly.

- Props: Data passed from parent to child. Child CANNOT change those props directly.
- Creat-React-App npm package used to generate a functional react application. run the npx command: npx create-react-app <app-name>

- Creatting React app: ALWAYS import REACT from 'react' / / class App extends from React.Component

- at the end of a component must export EX: export default 'class name'
