> What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
a pure function will always return the same output given a constant input, without causing new errors. pure functions are easier to read and understand and debug.

> What are the benefits of a pure function?
readability and debugg

> What is immutability?
unable to be changed/ unchanging

> What is Referential transparency?
given that a function given the same input will return the same output transparently

> What is a module?
a backend equivilent to a component on the front end -> reusable code with specific functionality

> What does the word ‘require’ do?
