# SQL REFLECTION

![SQL TUTORIAL](/Assets/CompleteSQL.PNG)

## Things to note: 

- Updating tables can be extremely dangerous and can change data unexpectedly if the QUERY is not SOLID

- The "LIKE" keyword will become my best friend

- Dropping tables if fun

### Short reflection:

- SQL Query language is extremely versitile in specific operations on an SQL database. This give the developer the UTMOST of control of how data is worked with, manupulated, changed... ect... This tool is extremely valueble and important to the integrity of our users data. As far as my understanding of SQL it is a Structured Query Language that allows specific manipulations of data, weather updating, creating, or deleting.
