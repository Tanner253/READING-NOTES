# Passing functions as props

- What does .map() return?

>map returns a new array consisting of data modified from a passed array through a callback function or operation.

- If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

>See code example

```js
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li>{number}</li>
);
```

- Each list item needs a unique ____.

>Key value

- What is the purpose of a key?

>Keys help react identify which items have changes are added or are removed. keys should be given to elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity

- What is the spread operator?

>The spread operator allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected.

- List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

>function calls, array literals, destructuring, array prototype methods?

- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

```js
const a = [1, 2, 3]
const b = [...a, 4] // b ==> [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

>example above

- Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

```js
let numberStore = [0, 1, 2];
let newNumber = 12;
numberStore = [...numberStore, newNumber];
```

>see above

- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

```js
let person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    age: 25,
    ssn: '123-456-2356'
};


let job = {
    jobTitle: 'JavaScript Developer',
    location: 'USA'
};

let employee = {
    ...person,
    ...job
};

console.log(employee);
```
